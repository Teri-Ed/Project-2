Website with a search engine.

• Your name

- Teri Edwards

• Overview/description of the project

- This project is designed to be a website with a search option that queries the GIPHY API and iterates a series of GIF files from the result of that search.  The search should be activated by a button click.  The query should be coded using an ajax call in jQuery.  The site should be responsive and items should be in a single column on mobile devices and wrap accordingly on larger screens.  

• Details on how to use it or what functionality is offered

- The site can be used by the input of a search term in the search bar and clicking the submit button to render search results.  Upon entering a new search term the pervious results will be wiped and new results rendered on the page.  The page will have three forms of search capability.  The first renders active looping and autoplaying GIFS.  The second renders GIFs with a play control button.  The third renders still images.
